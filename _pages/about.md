Welcome to the website of the **[RO]bust [A]utonomous [M]obility Lab. (ROAM Lab)**. 
ROAM Lab is directed by [Dr. Tolga Ozaslan]({{ "/cv/" | relative_url }})
 , and our research focuses on enabling autonomy in mobile robotic platforms — especially in **GPS-denied environments** — through advanced **perception and mapping systems**.

We develop and investigate a wide range of technologies spanning:

- **Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)** and **SLAM**
- **Sensor Fusion** with LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, and event sensors
- **State Estimation** (e.g., UKF, Kalman Filters)
- **Autonomous Navigation** for aerial and ground vehicles
- **Real-time 3D Mapping** and environmental modeling
- **Embedded AI systems** and robotics platforms

Our lab designs modular embedded systems that combine heterogeneous sensors, real-time computing, and advanced autonomy capabilities. These systems are deployed in applications including:

- **Search and rescue**
- **Defense**
- **Smart agriculture**
- **Infrastructure inspection**

We are also committed to **open-source development**, industry collaboration, and mentoring the next generation of roboticists.
