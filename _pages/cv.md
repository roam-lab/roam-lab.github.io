Dr. Tolga Özaslan received dual B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from Middle East Technical University (METU) in 2008. 
He was the first student in METU's history to complete a double major in these two departments. 
He pursued his graduate studies at Bilkent University, where he obtained an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Uluç Saranlı.

Dr. Özaslan earned his Ph.D. in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, conducting research at the [GRASP Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/) and [Prof. Camillo J. Taylor](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cjtaylor/home.html). 
His doctoral work focused on state estimation, mapping, and autonomous navigation for micro aerial vehicles operating in GPS-denied environments. 
Following his Ph.D., he worked as a Research Scientist at [Motional Inc.](www.motional.com) in Boston, where he contributed to the development of high-definition mapping and localization systems for self-driving vehicles.

Throughout his research career, Dr. Özaslan has led numerous field deployments involving mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles in challenging real-world environments. 
He has coordinated and executed over 20 site experiments at hydraulic infrastructures, including dams, tunnels, and penstocks, with more than 100 autonomous drone flights conducted inside confined underground structures. 
He is the sole inventor of a U.S. patent on point cloud processing for identifying drivable surfaces in complex environments.

Dr. Özaslan is currently a faculty member in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University, where he teaches courses in mechatronics, robotics, and control systems. 
He is the designer and instructor of the *Aerial Robotics* course, which introduces students to theoretical foundations of drone autonomy through simulation-based, hands-on exercises.

In addition to his academic work, Dr. Özaslan is an entrepreneur and the founder of [**Tayyar Robotics**](https://www.tayyar.ai), a company focused on developing autonomous drone technologies for GPS-denied environments. 
Tayyar Robotics specializes in real-time localization, mapping, and perception systems for aerial and ground robots operating in unstructured and unknown environments.
