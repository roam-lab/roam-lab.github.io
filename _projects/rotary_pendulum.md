## üß≠ About the Project

The **Rotary Inverted Pendulum** is a classic benchmark system in control engineering, designed to test a variety of control strategies under nonlinear and underactuated dynamics. This project provides a 3D-printable and modular version of the platform, suitable for both undergraduate and graduate-level education.

It consists of a rotary base driven by a DC motor, with a rigid pendulum attached at the end. The system is both **nonlinear** and **unstable**, requiring sophisticated controllers to maintain the upright position of the pendulum.
