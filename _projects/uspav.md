## üöÅ Project Overview

**USPAV** (Unmanned aerial vehicle with Suspended Payload: Analysis and Validation) is a research project focusing on the complex problem of planning and control for UAVs carrying suspended payloads. These systems exhibit highly nonlinear and underactuated dynamics due to cable-induced oscillations.

The project addresses key challenges such as:

- **Payload swing suppression**
- **Trajectory tracking under disturbance**
- **Optimal control under dynamic constraints**
