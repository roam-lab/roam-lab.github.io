## üöÅ Project Overview

**USPAV** (Unmanned aerial vehicle with Suspended Payload: Analysis and Validation) is a research project focusing on the complex problem of planning and control for UAVs carrying suspended payloads. These systems exhibit highly nonlinear and underactuated dynamics due to cable-induced oscillations.

The project addresses key challenges such as:

- **Payload swing suppression**
- **Trajectory tracking under disturbance**
- **Optimal control under dynamic constraints**

## ‚ú® Technical Highlights

- Nonlinear modeling of cable-suspended payload dynamics
- Real-time control implementations using MPC and LQR
- Simulation environment in ROS 2 and Gazebo
- Hardware-in-the-loop tests with a quadrotor testbed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Applications

- **Aerial logistics and cargo delivery**
- **Disaster response with UAV-deployed tools**
- **Autonomous aerial crane systems**
- **Academic education in nonlinear control**
