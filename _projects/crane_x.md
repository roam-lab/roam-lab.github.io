## üöß About CRANE-X

**CRANE-X** (*Crane Reach and Navigation Engine ‚Äì Experimental*) is a ROS 2-based application that applies Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) for generating dynamically feasible trajectories for gantry cranes. The system considers underactuated payload dynamics and supports obstacle-aware planning in constrained environments.

## üß† Technical Notes

CRANE-X leverages ROS 2, OMPL, and custom crane models. The planner produces piecewise waypoints smoothed using interpolation functions. The controller stack supports PID and LQR for closed-loop trajectory tracking, with visual feedback via RViz markers.
