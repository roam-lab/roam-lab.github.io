## üöó About EduRover

**EduRover** is a modular, open-source robotics platform based on **Mecanum wheels**. It is designed for *educational use*, enabling students and hobbyists to explore **autonomous navigation**, **control systems**, and **embedded programming**.

The platform is fully **3D-printable** and uses easily accessible components such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, LiDAR, and IMU modules. Its omnidirectional mobility makes it ideal for indoor SLAM and autonomous exploration projects.
