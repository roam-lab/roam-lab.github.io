## 🎯 Overview

**MAVES** is a lightweight, open-source simulation platform developed for the design and evaluation of UAV control algorithms in a simplified 2D planar setting. It targets educational and rapid prototyping use cases where full 3D dynamics may not be necessary.

Originally presented at **ISAS 2025**, the simulator offers real-time visualization, interactive command input, and modular physics configuration. It is implemented in Python using ROS 2 and integrates seamlessly with common control design workflows.
