This course introduces students to fundamental mechatronic components and instrumentation techniques used in modern engineering systems. 
Topics include sensors, actuators, signal conditioning, data acquisition, and control using microcontrollers. 
The course culminates in a hands-on term project involving real-time control of an unstable mechanical system.

## Course Objectives

- Understand core components in mechatronic systems, including sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers.
- Develop skills for signal processing and interfacing.
- Apply mechatronic principles to real-world systems through a design-based project.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will:

- Identify and use common sensors and actuators.
- Design circuits for signal conditioning and measurement.
- Integrate sensors and actuators with a control platform.
- Design, build, and demonstrate a functional mechatronic system.
- Communicate system design and performance both orally and in written form.

## Term Project

**Project Title:** Single-Axis Seesaw Attitude Control System  
Students will design and manufacture a real-time balancing system using a motor, a propeller, and an angle/attitude sensor. The project includes mechanical design, sensor integration, control algorithm development, and system testing.
