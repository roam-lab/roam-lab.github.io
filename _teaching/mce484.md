This course introduces students to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of aerial robotic systems, particularly Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) platforms such as quadrotors. 
Topics include modeling of aerial vehicles, 3D state and rotation representations, control techniques, motion planning algorithms, and state estimation methods using probabilistic filters.

## Course Objectives

The course aims to:

- Provide mathematical modeling tools for aerial robots.
- Develop control techniques suitable for aerial platforms.
- Teach planning and estimation algorithms used in autonomous aerial robotics.
- Equip students with the ability to implement simulation-based and/or lab-based control systems for drones.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the semester, students will be able to:

- Derive the equations of motion for multirotor aerial vehicles.
- Represent robot state in both 2D and 3D coordinate frames.
- Apply linear and nonlinear control strategies.
- Plan paths and trajectories using algorithms such as A*, RRT.
- Use state estimation techniques such as Kalman filters and particle filters.
- Demonstrate control of a simulated or physical drone in a controlled setting.
