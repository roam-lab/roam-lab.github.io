This course introduces perception techniques for autonomous mobile robots, with a focus on how to process data from sensors like IMUs, cameras, and lidars for tasks such as orientation estimation, mapping, and navigation.

## Course Objectives

The goal is to equip students with:

- An understanding of state estimation and perception for robotics.
- Practical experience in working with real-world sensor data.
- Programming skills to implement core algorithms in sensor fusion, optical flow, and point cloud processing.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Represent robot state using orientation and position models.
- Process IMU, camera, and lidar data for localization and mapping.
- Implement visual-inertial pose estimation and point cloud registration.
- Understand and apply projective geometry and image-based motion estimation.
