This course introduces undergraduate mechanical engineering students to the fundamental concepts of system dynamics and control. 
It covers mathematical modeling of physical systems, transient and steady-state response analysis, and basic controller design methods. 
The emphasis is placed on linear systems and their control using classical techniques such as PID tuning, root locus, and frequency response methods.

## Course Objectives

This course aims to:

- Equip students with the knowledge to model 1st and 2nd order dynamic systems.
- Analyze linear systems in the time and frequency domains.
- Develop an understanding of feedback systems and control strategies.
- Provide hands-on experience with classical control design techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Explain the structure and function of automatic control systems.
- Model and analyze 1st and 2nd order linear systems.
- Analyze transient and steady-state responses of dynamic systems.
- Design basic feedback controllers including PID regulators.
- Apply frequency response techniques for controller design.
- Analyze stability using classical methods.
