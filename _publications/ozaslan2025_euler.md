This book chapter presents a clear and comprehensive guide to the twelve Euler and Tait-Bryan angle conventions used to represent 3D rotations. Aimed at students, engineers, and researchers, it explains how to derive rotation matrices, extract angles, and understand the geometric meaning of different convention choices. With precise mathematical formulations and visual illustrations, the chapter serves as a practical reference in applications such as state estimation, navigation, and robotic control.
