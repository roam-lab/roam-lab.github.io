This thesis investigates the use of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) for infrastructure inspection in GPS-denied, tunnel-like environments such as dam penstocks. 
It presents methods for onboard state estimation, mapping, and navigation using IMU, cameras, and 2D/3D LiDARs. 
A key focus is on combining lidar and visual data through Kalman filtering to estimate 6-DOF states, particularly in dark and low-texture conditions. 
The work is validated through field deployments in multiple dams, demonstrating autonomous and shared control capabilities.
