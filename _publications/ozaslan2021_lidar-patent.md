This patent introduces a method for identifying background structures in LiDAR point cloud data to isolate foreground objects and extract drivable areas. 
The approach models the 3D environment as a spherical structure and segments point clusters into faces. 
A graph-based representation of these faces is constructed and analyzed to detect subgraphs representing background surfaces. 
The technique enables robust background segmentation critical for navigation and terrain understanding in autonomous systems.
