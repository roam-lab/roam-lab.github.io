This paper addresses the problem of autonomous navigation and inspection of penstocks and other tunnel-like environments using micro aerial vehicles (UAVs) with minimal sensing. Such environments lack visual features and pose a significant challenge for traditional localization systems.

The authors present a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter framework that fuses LiDAR and IMU measurements for robust localization in 3D tunnels. The system is validated through real-world deployments in dam infrastructure, demonstrating successful UAV-based mapping and autonomy in visually and structurally sparse environments.
