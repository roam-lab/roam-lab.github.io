This work presents a detailed technical treatment of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), including their constituent sensors: accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. These sensors are foundational in mobile robotics, where they provide high-frequency data critical for short-term state estimation.

The text explores the roles of these sensors in the Kalman filtering framework, emphasizing the importance of accurate calibration and noise modeling. It also discusses the strengths and limitations of IMUs and reviews the mathematical foundations of their integration into robotic systems.
