This paper introduces the first large-scale dataset collected using a synchronized stereo event camera system, deployed across a variety of vehicles including handheld rigs, hexacopters, cars, and motorcycles, under different illumination conditions. The dataset provides stereo event streams, grayscale images, IMU data, and GPS readings at up to 100 Hz. It aims to accelerate research in SLAM, visual odometry, and depth estimation in event-based vision systems. The publication offers an essential resource for benchmarking and algorithm development in 3D perception with novel sensor modalities.
